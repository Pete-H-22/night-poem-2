#forgotten nights#

Here you can find the HTML/CSS and Javascript for the web interface that I developed for the poem 'forgotten nights', along with the audio files that make up the poem.

Replacing the files within the 'sound' folder and editing the file references within lines.js will allow you to add your own recordings to the app. Control over the order and selection of the lines can be found in the main.js file, in the poem_constructor() function.

More detailed breakdown of the code and how it can be edited coming soon - either here or within the JS file comments.
